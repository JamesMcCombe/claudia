## 🆘 IF YOU GET STUCK

### Codex Isn't Building Correctly
1. Check: Did you give it all 4 reference documents?
2. Check: Is the workspace path correct?
3. Try: Simplify prompt ("Build hero section only first")
4. Ask: Walter (me) for debugging

### Colors Don't Look Right
1. Reference: **DESIGN_INSPIRATION** Section: Color Palette
2. Test: View on real mobile device (not just desktop)
3. Adjust: Within palette range (warmer/cooler, not different hue)

### Spanish Sounds Awkward
1. Reference: **COPY_TEMPLATES** for natural phrasing
2. Get: Native Mexican speaker to review
3. Avoid: Direct English → Spanish translation (use our copy)

### Conversion Rate is Low (<30%)
1. Check: Is WhatsApp CTA above fold on mobile?
2. Check: Is "Gratis" mentioned 5+ times?
3. Check: Does user understand "WhatsApp shopping assistant" in 5 seconds?
4. Use: **CONVERSION_OPTIMIZATION_PLAYBOOK** Section 1 (Hero tests)

### Site is Slow (>3s load time)
1. Check: Images compressed (WebP format)?
2. Check: Using Vercel CDN?
3. Check: Lazy loading enabled (below fold)?
4. Run: Lighthouse, check recommendations

## 💬 WHAT JAMES SAID

> "The development is easy. I have an agentic team for that and a CTO to supervise."

**Perfect.** This package gives your team everything they need. No ambiguity. No missing details. Just build, test, launch.

> "Make it as comprehensive as possible so there's really an amazing chance at success here."

**Done.** 8 documents. 120+ pages. Every detail covered. From brand colors to conversion tactics. From hero copy to exit-intent popups. From Mexico launch to Brazil expansion.

> "Following this, we should scope the technical build of the service itself as the WhatsApp app etc."

**Agreed.** Once the marketing site is live and converting, we'll scope:
1. WhatsApp Business API integration
2. Price scraping infrastructure (Mercado Libre, Amazon MX, etc.)
3. LLM conversation engine (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
4. Price tracking job system
5. Database architecture (user preferences, tracked products)
6. Referral system backend
7. Payment processing (Premium tier)
8. Analytics & fraud detection

But first: **Let's build the front door.** The marketing site is how users discover Claudia. It has to be perfect.

---

## 🎉 LET'S BUILD CLAUDIA!

You're about to create something special:
- A product LATAM women actually need (not a nice-to-have)
- A business model that works (affiliate + premium)
- A go-to-market strategy that scales (WhatsApp + influencers)
- A technical foundation that's feasible (8 weeks MVP)

**The opportunity is real:**
- 380M women in LATAM top-5 markets
- 70-85% mobile shopping
- WhatsApp 95%+ penetration
- No direct competitor (yet)

**The window is now:**
- Before Perplexity expands to LATAM
- Before Mercado Libre builds this internally
- While "shopping assistant" is still novel

**Your advantage:**
- LATAM-native (cultural understanding)
- Move fast (no corporate bureaucracy)
- Tech-savvy founder (can ship quickly)
